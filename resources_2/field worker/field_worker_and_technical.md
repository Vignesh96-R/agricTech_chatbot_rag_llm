# Agricultural Field Workers & Technicians Knowledge Base

## 1. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### **1.1 Tractor Operation**
1. Perform pre-start checks: fuel, oil, coolant, tire pressure.
2. Engage parking brake before starting.
3. Start engine and let idle for 2–3 minutes.
4. Shift into appropriate gear before movement.
5. Avoid sudden acceleration to reduce wear.
6. After work, clean air filters and check fluid levels.

### **1.2 Seed Drill Operation**
1. Level the seedbed before drilling.
2. Adjust seed rate using calibration lever.
3. Fill hopper with clean, dry seeds.
4. Engage PTO at recommended speed.
5. Periodically check seed flow during operation.
6. Clean hopper after use to prevent blockage.

### **1.3 Harvester Operation**
1. Check belts, chains, and blades before starting.
2. Adjust cutting height for crop type.
3. Engage header gently before moving forward.
4. Maintain consistent speed for optimal yield.
5. Inspect grain tank regularly to prevent overfilling.
6. Clean machinery thoroughly after use.

## 2. Troubleshooting Guides

| Equipment      | Problem                  | Possible Cause              | Solution                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Tractor        | Engine won't start        | Battery low                 | Recharge or replace battery            |
|                | Engine overheating        | Low coolant, clogged radiator| Top-up coolant, clean radiator         |
| Seed Drill     | Uneven seed distribution  | Blocked tubes               | Clean tubes and seed cups              |
| Harvester      | Poor grain separation     | Wrong fan speed             | Adjust fan speed to crop requirements  |
|                | Clogged header            | Wet crop or debris          | Stop, clear blockage before resuming   |

## 3. Equipment Calibration Diagrams

### **Seed Drill Calibration**
[Seed Hopper] --> [Seed Metering Mechanism] --> [Delivery Tubes] --> [Soil Furrows]
- **Step 1:** Adjust lever to match desired seed rate (kg/ha).
- **Step 2:** Test run for 10 meters, collect seeds, weigh and verify rate.
- **Step 3:** Adjust as necessary.

### **Harvester Header Height Adjustment**
[Header Frame] <--> [Height Adjustment Lever] --> [Hydraulic Cylinders]
- **Rule:** Maintain 5–7 cm above ground for wheat; adjust for crop type.

## 4. Safety Checklists

### **Before Operation**
- [ ] Check all guards and shields are in place.
- [ ] Ensure all bolts and nuts are tightened.
- [ ] Wear safety shoes, gloves, and ear protection.
- [ ] Keep bystanders away from operating area.

### **During Operation**
- [ ] Maintain safe distance from moving parts.
- [ ] Avoid sharp turns at high speeds.
- [ ] Monitor gauges for temperature and oil pressure.

### **After Operation**
- [ ] Shut off engine and remove key.
- [ ] Disconnect PTO before maintenance.
- [ ] Clean equipment and store in dry area.
