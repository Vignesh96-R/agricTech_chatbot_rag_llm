# Farmer Knowledge Base

## 1. Crop Care
Proper crop care ensures healthy yields and sustainable farming.

### Key Practices:
- **Seed Selection**: Choose certified seeds suited to your region and climate.
- **Timely Planting**: Follow the sowing calendar for your specific crops.
- **Weeding**: Remove weeds regularly to avoid competition for nutrients and water.
- **Crop Rotation**: Rotate crops annually to prevent soil nutrient depletion.

## 2. Soil Health
Healthy soil is the foundation of productive farming.

### Improving Soil Health:
- Add **organic matter** like compost or farmyard manure.
- Test soil every year for pH and nutrient levels.
- Avoid overuse of chemical fertilizers.
- Practice minimal tillage to preserve soil structure.

| Soil Type       | Ideal pH Range | Recommended Organic Input  |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Sandy           | 5.5 – 6.5      | Compost, green manure      |
| Loamy           | 6.0 – 7.0      | Farmyard manure, cover crops|
| Clay            | 6.5 – 7.5      | Compost, gypsum            |

## 3. Pest Control
Pests can drastically reduce yield if not managed.

### Pest Management Steps:
1. **Monitor** crops regularly for early signs.
2. **Identify** the pest using a field guide or pest chart.
3. **Apply** control measures:
   - **Cultural**: Crop rotation, clean fields.
   - **Biological**: Introduce pest predators.
   - **Chemical**: Use pesticides only as a last resort.

| Pest Name           | Symptoms                        | Control Method                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Aphids              | Curling leaves, sticky residue  | Neem oil spray, ladybugs        |
| Fruit Borer         | Holes in fruits, frass inside   | Pheromone traps, handpicking    |
| Leaf Miner          | White trails on leaves          | Remove affected leaves          |

## 4. Irrigation Methods
Efficient irrigation saves water and improves yields.

### Common Irrigation Methods:
- **Drip Irrigation**: Delivers water directly to roots.
- **Sprinkler Irrigation**: Suitable for vegetables and lawns.
- **Furrow Irrigation**: For row crops like maize and cotton.

| Crop Type      | Irrigation Frequency (Dry Season) | Irrigation Frequency (Monsoon) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Wheat          | Every 7–10 days                   | Every 12–15 days                |
| Rice           | Maintain standing water           | Rain-fed; supplementary if dry  |
| Vegetables     | Every 3–4 days                    | Every 6–8 days                   |

## 5. Seasonal Best Practices

### Monsoon Season:
- Use raised beds to avoid waterlogging.
- Apply organic mulch to retain moisture and prevent soil erosion.
- Select pest-resistant crop varieties.

### Dry Season:
- Install drip irrigation systems.
- Plant drought-tolerant crops like millets.
- Cover soil with mulch to reduce evaporation.

## 6. Fertilizer Schedule

| Crop     | Growth Stage       | Fertilizer Type   | Quantity per Acre |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Rice     | 20 days after sowing| Urea              | 35 kg             |
| Rice     | 40 days after sowing| DAP               | 25 kg             |
| Tomato   | At flowering        | NPK (15:15:15)    | 30 kg             |
| Wheat    | Before sowing       | Farmyard Manure   | 2 tons            |

---

**Tip:** Always follow local agricultural extension guidelines for exact fertilizer dosages based on soil tests.

## 7. Watering Frequency Guide

| Crop     | Season   | Watering Frequency |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Rice     | Monsoon  | Rain-fed           |
| Rice     | Dry      | Every 5–7 days     |
| Tomato   | Monsoon  | Every 6–8 days     |
| Tomato   | Dry      | Every 2–3 days     |
| Wheat    | Monsoon  | Every 12–15 days   |
| Wheat    | Dry      | Every 7–10 days    |

---

**Final Advice:** Keep detailed farm records to track crop performance, pest outbreaks, and soil health over time. This helps make informed decisions each season.
