# ðŸ“¦ Agricultural Supply Chain Management Knowledge Base

This knowledge base provides detailed guidelines and standard operating procedures for managing agricultural supply chains efficiently.

---

## 1. Warehouse Capacity Management

- Maintain a **real-time inventory log** to avoid overstocking or understocking.
- Allocate space based on **crop perishability** and **market demand**.
- Use **FIFO (First In, First Out)** system to ensure freshness.
- Conduct **monthly capacity audits**.

**Formula for Storage Utilization:**  
```
Storage Utilization (%) = (Occupied Space / Total Storage Space) Ã— 100
```

## 2. Cold Storage Practices

- Maintain **0â€“4Â°C** for leafy greens, **5â€“7Â°C** for fruits, and **0Â°C** for potatoes.
- Install humidity controls to prevent moisture loss.
- Use ethylene absorbers for fruits sensitive to ripening gases.
- Inspect cold rooms daily for temperature fluctuations.

**Table â€“ Optimal Storage Conditions per Crop**

| Crop       | Temperature (Â°C) | Relative Humidity (%) | Shelf Life |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Tomatoes   | 7â€“10              | 85â€“90                 | 7â€“14 days  |
| Potatoes   | 0â€“4               | 90â€“95                 | 2â€“4 months |
| Bananas    | 13â€“14             | 90â€“95                 | 2â€“3 weeks  |
| Leafy Greens | 0â€“4              | 95â€“100                | 10â€“14 days |

## 3. Transport Scheduling

- Schedule deliveries during **cooler parts of the day** to reduce spoilage.
- Maintain **backup vehicles** during harvest peaks.
- Use GPS tracking for route optimization.
- Coordinate with farmers to ensure **just-in-time harvesting**.

**Checklist â€“ Shipment Preparation**

- [ ] Verify order quantity and crop quality  
- [ ] Use correct packaging material  
- [ ] Label shipments with storage requirements  
- [ ] Pre-cool produce before loading  
- [ ] Secure goods inside vehicles  

---

## 4. Packaging Guidelines

- Use **ventilated crates** for fresh produce.
- Avoid stacking heavy items over delicate crops.
- For exports, comply with **international packaging standards**.
- Label with **batch number**, **harvest date**, and **destination**.

---

## 5. Inventory Tracking Methods

- Use **barcode or RFID** systems for tracking.
- Keep daily records of incoming and outgoing goods.
- Automate reports for wastage and spoilage rates.
- Integrate inventory data with **sales forecasts**.

---

## 6. SOPs for Logistics During Peak Harvest

1. **Increase workforce** during peak seasons.  
2. **Pre-book transportation** at least 2 weeks before harvest.  
3. **Stagger harvesting schedules** to avoid storage bottlenecks.  
4. Arrange **24/7 loading/unloading teams** during peak days.

---

## 7. Emergency Response Plan

- Have a **contingency warehouse** for overflow storage.
- Maintain contracts with **alternative logistics providers**.
- Keep a list of **cold storage facilities** in nearby districts.
