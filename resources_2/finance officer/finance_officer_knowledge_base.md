## 2. Crop Cost Analysis Methods
### Steps for Cost Analysis:
1. **Identify Fixed Costs**: Land lease, salaries, equipment depreciation.
2. **Identify Variable Costs**: Seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation costs.
3. **Calculate Total Cost per Acre**:
Total Cost per Acre = (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs) / Total Acres
4. **Compare Against Expected Yield** to determine cost per unit of produce.

| Crop     | Fixed Cost (₹/Acre) | Variable Cost (₹/Acre) | Total Cost (₹/Acre) |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Rice     | 10,000              | 12,000                 | 22,000              |
| Wheat    | 8,500               | 9,800                  | 18,300              |
| Maize    | 7,000               | 8,500                  | 15,500              |

## 3. Profit Margin Calculations
Formula:
Profit Margin (%) = [(Selling Price per Unit - Cost per Unit) / Selling Price per Unit] × 100

**Example:**
- Selling Price for Wheat: ₹25/kg
- Cost per kg: ₹18/kg
- Profit Margin = ((25 - 18) / 25) × 100 = **28%**

### Subsidy Tracker Table:

## 6. Seasonal Price Fluctuations
| Crop     | Price (₹/kg) - Peak Season | Price (₹/kg) - Off Season | Variation (%) |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Rice     | 28                        | 22                        | -21.4%        |
| Wheat    | 25                        | 18                        | -28.0%        |
| Tomato   | 35                        | 20                        | -42.8%        |

**Impact:** Price drops during off-season reduce profitability; forward contracts can stabilize income.

## 7. ROI Calculations
Formula:
ROI (%) = [(Total Revenue - Total Costs) / Total Costs] × 100
**Example:**
- Revenue: ₹5,00,000
- Total Costs: ₹3,50,000
- ROI = ((5,00,000 - 3,50,000) / 3,50,000) × 100 = **42.85%**

## 8. Best Practices for Financial Management
- Maintain separate accounts for each crop cycle.
- Conduct quarterly profitability reviews.
- Leverage government financial aid programs.
- Avoid high-interest loans during low market prices.
