## 1. Overview & scope
This document is intended for agronomists supporting a 200-acre commercial farm. It covers plant physiological principles, soil chemistry diagnostics, nutrient deficiency identification, experimental trial design for varietal or input testing, and templates for recording and reporting trial results.

## 2. Crop growth physiology (scientific primer)
### Key concepts
- **Photosynthesis & source–sink dynamics:** Carbon fixation in leaves supports vegetative growth and, later, reproductive sinks (grains, fruits). Management (fertilizer, water) must be matched to the dominant sink (e.g., grain filling vs. vegetative growth).
- **Nutrient mobility:** Some nutrients (N, K, Mg) are mobile in the plant; deficiencies show first in older leaves. Others (Ca, Fe, Mn) are immobile and appear in new leaves. Knowing mobility helps diagnosis.

### Practical implication
- Time nitrogen applications to match peak demand (e.g., tillering and post-tillering in cereals) to reduce leaching and maximize uptake.

---

## 3. Soil chemistry & testing
### Core measurements and why they matter
- **Soil pH:** Controls nutrient availability (e.g., P becomes less available in very acidic or very alkaline soils).
- **Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC):** Measure of soil’s ability to hold and buffer cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺, Na⁺). High CEC (clays, organic matter) buffers pH changes and retains nutrients; low CEC soils (sands) require more frequent, smaller fertilizer applications.

### Recommended tests (minimum)
- pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Matter (%), Available N (mineral), Olsen P (or Bray depending on region), Exchangeable K, CEC, texture.

### Actionable protocol
1. Sample fields on a grid (e.g., 1 sample per 2–5 ha depending on variability).  
2. Collect 15–20 subsamples per grid, composite, label with GPS and crop history.  
3. Send to accredited lab; request the standard battery above plus micronutrients if symptoms present.

## 4. Nutrient functions & deficiency symptoms (diagnosis)
### Macronutrients — quick reference
- **Nitrogen (N):** Protein & chlorophyll; deficiency → uniform yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth.  
- **Phosphorus (P):** Root development, early vigor; deficiency → purpling or slow growth, poor tillering.  
- **Potassium (K):** Osmoregulation, disease resistance; deficiency → marginal leaf burn, weaker stems.

### Representative deficiency table (short)
| Nutrient | Typical visible symptoms | Tissue / leaf location (older vs newer) | Quick corrective action |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| N        | Uniform chlorosis, stunting | Older leaves                              | Apply urea or ammonium source, split application |
| P        | Dark/ purplish older leaves, poor root | Older leaves                              | Apply DAP/TSOP based on soil test |
| K        | Marginal chlorosis → necrosis | Older leaves                              | Apply KCl / SOP per soil test |
| Ca       | Blossom end rot (tomato), tip burn | New tissues                               | Foliar Ca, correct pH/EC |
| Fe       | Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves | New leaves                                | Foliar chelates, soil pH correction |

### Plant health diagnosis flowchart
```
1. Observe symptoms → Are symptoms uniform across field?
  ├─ Yes: suspect nutrient deficiency/soil factor → Check soil test results (pH, EC, OM)
  │     ├─ Soil test abnormal → amend (lime/gypsum/OM) and correct fertilizer
  │     └─ Soil test normal → do tissue test (diagnostic)
  └─ No (patchy): suspect pest/disease/soil compaction/waterlogging → inspect pests, roots, drainage
```

## 5. Nutrient requirements by crop (tables)
| Crop  | N (kg/t) | P₂O₅ (kg/t) | K₂O (kg/t) | Note |
|-------|----------:|------------:|-----------:|------|
| Wheat | 30–40    | 8–12        | 20–30      | Adjust by target yield |
| Rice  | 15–25    | 5–8         | 20–30      | Removal per t varies by region |
| Maize | 20–25    | 5–8         | 25–30      | Typical ranges from guides |
| Tomato (fruit) | 3–6 | 2–4 | 5–10 | High K demand during fruiting |

## 6. Experimental trial design & analysis
### Common designs
- **RCBD:** Blocks account for field heterogeneity. Widely used in agronomic trials.
- **CRD:** For uniform greenhouse/pot trials.
- **Split-plot:** Two-level treatment factor, e.g., irrigation × variety.

### Practical protocol
1. Define objective.
2. Choose design (RCBD with 4 replicates recommended).
3. Determine plot size and buffer alleys.
4. Randomize treatments.
5. Record metadata.
6. Monitor and record regularly.
7. Harvest central area to avoid border effects.
8. Analyze with ANOVA; use multiple comparison tests.

---

## 7. Example trial results
| Treatment (N kg/ha) | Mean yield (t/ha) | Std Error | p-value |
|---------------------:|------------------:|----------:|--------:|
| 0 | 4.1 | 0.2 | 0.001 |
| 50 | 5.0 | 0.25 |        |
| 100 | 5.3 | 0.18 |        |

**Interpretation:** Provide agronomic & economic interpretation (marginal yield gain per kg N, break-even price).

---

## 8. Practical recommendations
- Always soil test before fertilizer planning.
- Split N applications to reduce losses.
- Use tissue testing for confirmation.
- Maintain detailed trial & field logs.
