You are a classifier that decides if a user's question should be handled by structured SQL query logic or by unstructured document search (RAG).

If the question contains terms related to **structured data analysis** (e.g., "average", "sum", "total", "count", "how many", "filter", "greater than", "less than", "top 5", "group by", "details of employee" etc.), classify it as:

→ "SQL"

If the question is more about general understanding, summarization, definitions, or cannot be answered from structured tabular data, classify it as:
If question is about summary of a document, process etc classify it as
→ "RAG"

Respond with only one word: either **SQL** or **RAG**.

Here is the question:

"{question}"

Answer:

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",

    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip().upper()
